Overview 
----

This app will be a one-stop shop for storing, sharing, and chronicling your amateur mixology journey. Not only will you be able to add recipes that you’ve seen (or even invented), you can remind yourself whether or not you’ve made it yet and if you liked it. Automatically organize your recipes by ingredient, style, or any other custom criteria. You’ll be able to upload and share pictures along with your recipes and comment on shared recipes to crowdsource the perfect cocktail.
